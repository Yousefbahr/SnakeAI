# SnakeAI
An AI agent that plays snake using a backtracking algorithm

- Instead of using a  A* algorithm or other shortest path algorithms, I used a backtracking algorithm because it's not about finding the shortest path rather it's about finding the most effiecient path where the agent (snake) doesn't collide with itself in the end of that path.
